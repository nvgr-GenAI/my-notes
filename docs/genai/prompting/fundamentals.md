# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing inputs to language models to achieve desired outputs. It has emerged as a crucial skill for effectively leveraging generative AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs).

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is the input text provided to a language model that guides its response. Prompts can range from simple questions to complex instructions with examples and context. The effectiveness of a prompt depends on how well it communicates intent, provides necessary context, and constrains the model's output appropriately.

## Basic Prompt Components

A well-structured prompt typically includes some combination of these elements:

1. **Instruction**: Clear direction on what the model should do
2. **Context**: Relevant background information
3. **Input Data**: Specific content for the model to process
4. **Output Format**: Specification of how the response should be structured
5. **Examples**: Demonstrations of desired inputs and outputs

### Example of a Structured Prompt

```
# Instruction
Analyze the sentiment of the following customer review and categorize it as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Context
You are an AI assistant helping an e-commerce company understand customer feedback. Focus on the overall tone and specific sentiments expressed about product features, customer service, and delivery experience.

# Input Data
"I received my order yesterday, three days earlier than expected. The headphones sound amazing with deep bass and clear highs. However, the ear cushions feel a bit stiff and uncomfortable after an hour of use. The packaging was minimal and environmentally friendly, which I appreciate."

# Output Format
Please provide your analysis as:
- Overall sentiment: [positive/negative/neutral]
- Key positive points: [bullet list]
- Key negative points: [bullet list]
- Reasoning: [2-3 sentences explaining your analysis]
```

## Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting means asking the model to perform a task without providing any examples:

```
Explain quantum computing to a six-year-old child.
```

Zero-shot works well for:
- Simple, common tasks
- Tasks the model was likely exposed to during training
- When you want to test the model's default approach

### Making Zero-Shot Prompts Effective

Even without examples, you can improve zero-shot prompts:

```python
# Simple zero-shot prompt
basic_prompt = "Translate this text to French: 'I enjoy learning about artificial intelligence.'"

# Enhanced zero-shot prompt
enhanced_prompt = """
You are a highly skilled translator with expertise in French. Translate the following English text to French, 
maintaining the original tone and meaning while ensuring natural, fluent French that a native speaker would use.

Text to translate: "I enjoy learning about artificial intelligence."
"""

# Using with an LLM API
import openai

response_basic = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": basic_prompt}]
)

response_enhanced = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": enhanced_prompt}]
)

print("Basic response:", response_basic.choices[0].message.content)
print("Enhanced response:", response_enhanced.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting provides examples of the task before asking the model to perform it:

```
Convert these company names to their stock ticker symbols:

Company: Apple
Ticker: AAPL

Company: Microsoft
Ticker: MSFT

Company: Google
Ticker: GOOGL

Company: Amazon
Ticker: 
```

This approach helps:
- Demonstrate the expected format
- Guide the model on edge cases
- Establish patterns for complex tasks

### Implementing Few-Shot Learning

The key to effective few-shot prompting is selecting diverse, representative examples:

```python
def generate_few_shot_prompt(examples, new_input, task_description):
    """
    Create a few-shot prompt based on examples
    
    Args:
        examples: List of (input, output) tuples
        new_input: New input requiring completion
        task_description: Description of the task
    
    Returns:
        Formatted few-shot prompt
    """
    prompt = f"{task_description}\n\n"
    
    # Add examples
    for input_text, output_text in examples:
        prompt += f"Input: {input_text}\nOutput: {output_text}\n\n"
    
    # Add new input
    prompt += f"Input: {new_input}\nOutput:"
    
    return prompt

# Example usage
sentiment_examples = [
    ("The movie was amazing! I loved every minute of it.", "Positive"),
    ("The service was terrible and the food was cold.", "Negative"),
    ("The product arrived on time. It works as expected.", "Neutral")
]

new_review = "I waited for two hours and the customer support never called back."

prompt = generate_few_shot_prompt(
    sentiment_examples,
    new_review,
    "Classify the sentiment of the following texts as Positive, Negative, or Neutral."
)

print(prompt)
```

## Chain of Thought Prompting

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting encourages the model to break down complex reasoning tasks into steps:

```
Question: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?

Let's think through this step by step:
1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.
2. He buys 2 cans of tennis balls.
3. Each can contains 3 tennis balls.
4. So the 2 cans contain 2 × 3 = 6 tennis balls.
5. The total number of tennis balls is 5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, Roger has 11 tennis balls.
```

This technique is particularly effective for:
- Mathematical problems
- Logical reasoning
- Multi-step tasks
- Problems requiring careful analysis

### Implementing Chain of Thought

There are two primary approaches to CoT prompting:

1. **Manual CoT**: Explicitly instruct the model to think step by step

```python
cot_prompt = """
Question: A shirt initially costs $25. During a sale, the price is reduced by 20%. After the sale, the price increases by 15%. What is the final price?

Think through this step by step:
"""

# Model will (hopefully) respond with something like:
"""
1. Initial price is $25.
2. During the sale, the price is reduced by 20%: $25 × 0.20 = $5 discount.
3. The sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.
4. After the sale, the price increases by 15% from the sale price: $20 × 0.15 = $3 increase.
5. The final price is $20 + $3 = $23.

Therefore, the final price of the shirt is $23.
"""
```

2. **Zero-shot CoT**: Simply add "Let's think step by step" to your prompt

```python
regular_prompt = "What is 17 × 28?"

zero_shot_cot_prompt = "What is 17 × 28? Let's think step by step."
```

## System Instructions

Many modern LLMs support a "system" role that sets the behavior, personality, or constraints of the model:

```python
import openai

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful mathematics tutor specializing in algebra. Explain concepts clearly at a high school level. Always include an example problem with solution."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain quadratic equations?"}
]

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=messages
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Effective system instructions can:
- Define the model's persona and tone
- Set global constraints on responses
- Establish domain expertise
- Define formatting preferences
- Specify ethical guidelines

### Example System Instructions

For a professional assistant:
```
You are a professional executive assistant. Communicate in a concise, professional manner. Prioritize clarity and efficiency in your responses. When scheduling or planning is involved, always consider logistics and provide specific time frames. Your responses should be helpful, direct, and focused on resolving the user's needs with minimal back-and-forth.
```

For a creative writing assistant:
```
You are a creative writing coach with expertise in fiction, poetry, and narrative non-fiction. Provide thoughtful, constructive feedback that balances encouragement with substantive suggestions for improvement. Use literary terminology appropriately and refer to relevant examples from literature when helpful. Adapt your guidance to the user's apparent skill level.
```

## Prompt Structure Patterns

### The Persona Pattern

Assigning a specific role or persona to the model:

```
You are an experienced Python developer with expertise in asynchronous programming and performance optimization. Your code is always well-documented, efficient, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
```

### The Template Pattern

Creating a consistent structure for similar prompts:

```python
def create_product_description_prompt(product_info):
    template = """
    Create a compelling product description for an e-commerce website based on the following information:
    
    Product Name: {name}
    Category: {category}
    Key Features:
    {features}
    Target Audience: {audience}
    Price Point: {price_point}
    Unique Selling Proposition: {usp}
    
    The description should be approximately 100-150 words, highlight the key features, 
    speak directly to the target audience, and emphasize the unique selling proposition.
    Use an engaging, {tone} tone that would appeal to {audience}.
    """
    
    features_formatted = "\n".join([f"- {feature}" for feature in product_info["features"]])
    
    return template.format(
        name=product_info["name"],
        category=product_info["category"],
        features=features_formatted,
        audience=product_info["audience"],
        price_point=product_info["price_point"],
        usp=product_info["usp"],
        tone=product_info["tone"]
    )

# Example usage
product = {
    "name": "UltraFocus Noise-Canceling Headphones",
    "category": "Audio Equipment",
    "features": ["40-hour battery life", "Active noise cancellation", "Memory foam ear cushions", "Voice assistant integration"],
    "audience": "busy professionals and frequent travelers",
    "price_point": "premium",
    "usp": "uninterrupted focus anywhere with industry-leading noise cancellation",
    "tone": "sophisticated yet approachable"
}

prompt = create_product_description_prompt(product)
print(prompt)
```

### The Constraints Pattern

Setting clear boundaries and limitations:

```
Write a summary of the provided article about climate change policy. Your summary must:
- Be no more than 100 words
- Include at least one key statistic from the article
- Not include your opinion or additional information not in the article
- Focus on policy implications rather than scientific details
- Be written at a 9th-grade reading level
```

### The Audience Focus Pattern

Tailoring content for specific audiences:

```
Explain how blockchain technology works. Your explanation should be targeted at senior business executives who have limited technical background but need to understand the business implications. Focus on practical applications and value propositions rather than cryptographic details.
```

## Testing and Refining Prompts

Prompt development is an iterative process. Here's a systematic approach:

```python
class PromptTester:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.test_cases = []
        self.results = []
        
    def add_test_case(self, prompt_variant, input_data, expected_output=None):
        """Add a test case for evaluation"""
        self.test_cases.append({
            "prompt": prompt_variant,
            "input": input_data,
            "expected": expected_output
        })
        
    def run_tests(self):
        """Run all test cases through the model"""
        import openai
        
        for i, test in enumerate(self.test_cases):
            full_prompt = test["prompt"].format(input=test["input"])
            
            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model=self.model_name,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": full_prompt}]
            )
            
            output = response.choices[0].message.content
            
            self.results.append({
                "prompt_variant": test["prompt"],
                "input": test["input"],
                "output": output,
                "expected": test["expected"],
                "tokens_used": response.usage.total_tokens
            })
            
            print(f"Completed test case {i+1}/{len(self.test_cases)}")
            
    def evaluate_results(self):
        """Analyze performance of different prompt variants"""
        # Group by prompt variant
        by_prompt = {}
        for result in self.results:
            prompt = result["prompt"]
            if prompt not in by_prompt:
                by_prompt[prompt] = []
            by_prompt[prompt].append(result)
        
        # Calculate aggregate metrics
        metrics = []
        for prompt, results in by_prompt.items():
            avg_tokens = sum(r["tokens_used"] for r in results) / len(results)
            
            metrics.append({
                "prompt_variant": prompt,
                "test_cases": len(results),
                "avg_tokens": avg_tokens,
                "results": results
            })
        
        return metrics
```

## Common Prompt Patterns For Different Tasks

### Classification Tasks

```
Classify the following text into one of these categories: {categories}

Text: "{input}"

Classification:
```

### Content Generation

```
Write a {content_type} about {topic}. The {content_type} should:
- Be approximately {length} words
- Use a {tone} tone
- Include the following key points: {key_points}
- Target an audience of {audience}
- Include a compelling {headline_type} headline
```

### Data Extraction

```
Extract the following information from this {document_type}:
- {field1}
- {field2}
- {field3}

Format the output as a JSON object with these fields.

{document_type}:
"{input}"
```

### Translation and Style Transfer

```
Rewrite the following text in a {target_style} style. Maintain the original meaning but adapt the tone, vocabulary, and sentence structure to match the {target_style} style.

Original text: "{input}"

{target_style} version:
```

## Prompt Debugging Techniques

When your prompts aren't producing the desired results, try these debugging approaches:

1. **Deconstruction Test**: Break a complex prompt into smaller parts to identify where issues occur
2. **Progressive Elaboration**: Start with a simple version and gradually add complexity
3. **Constraint Testing**: Remove constraints one by one to see which ones are causing issues
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare two prompt variants with minimal differences

Example of progressive elaboration:

```python
# Start with basic prompt
basic_prompt = "Summarize this article about quantum computing"

# Add length constraint
v2_prompt = "Summarize this article about quantum computing in 3-4 sentences"

# Add audience specification
v3_prompt = "Summarize this article about quantum computing in 3-4 sentences for a high school student"

# Add tone guidance
v4_prompt = "Summarize this article about quantum computing in 3-4 sentences for a high school student. Use an enthusiastic tone that conveys the excitement of the field"

# Add focus area
v5_prompt = "Summarize this article about quantum computing in 3-4 sentences for a high school student. Use an enthusiastic tone that conveys the excitement of the field. Focus on practical applications rather than technical details"

# Test each version to see which elements improve or degrade performance
```

## The Importance of Context

LLMs have no access to real-time information beyond their training data. Providing adequate context is essential:

```
Today is May 27, 2025. Given this date, provide a list of upcoming major technology conferences in the next 3 months. Include the conference name, dates, location, and main focus areas. Only include confirmed events that are scheduled, not speculative ones.
```

Context becomes even more important for domain-specific tasks:

```
Context: You are reviewing code for a Django web application that uses Django REST Framework for its API. The application is a content management system for a media company.

The following code snippet is from a view that handles article submissions. Review the code for security issues, best practices, and potential bugs. Focus specifically on authentication, permissions, input validation, and query optimization.

```python
@api_view(['POST'])
def submit_article(request):
    data = request.data
    title = data.get('title')
    content = data.get('content')
    category_id = data.get('category_id')
    
    category = Category.objects.get(id=category_id)
    
    article = Article.objects.create(
        title=title,
        content=content,
        category=category,
        author=request.user
    )
    
    return Response({"id": article.id}, status=201)
```
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed instructions yield better results
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Use Examples**: Demonstrate the desired output format and style
4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Use step-by-step instructions
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Treat prompt design as an experimental process
6. **Test Different Approaches**: Compare zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT methods
7. **Consider the User**: Tailor your prompts to the end user's needs
8. **Set Constraints**: Define clear boundaries for the model's responses
9. **Use Consistent Structure**: Develop reusable templates for similar tasks
10. **Version Control Your Prompts**: Track changes and improvements systematically

Effective prompt engineering is both an art and a science. By understanding these fundamental principles and patterns, you can create more effective prompts that unlock the full potential of generative AI systems.
