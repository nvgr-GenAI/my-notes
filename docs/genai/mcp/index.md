# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized approach for managing interactions between applications and large language models. It provides a structured way for models to communicate with tools, maintain context, and handle various interaction patterns.

## Core Concepts

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol defines how applications interact with AI models by standardizing:

- Request and response formats
- Context management and preservation
- Function calling and tool integration
- Error handling and feedback mechanisms

This standardization enables consistent interactions across different model providers and simplifies integration of AI capabilities into applications.

### Key Components

The protocol consists of several essential elements:

1. **Context Management**: Mechanisms for tracking conversation history and maintaining state
2. **Function Registry**: Definition and discovery of available tools and functions
3. **Message Format**: Standardized structure for requests and responses
4. **Tool Integration**: Patterns for AI models to use external tools and APIs

## Benefits of MCP

- **Interoperability**: Common protocol works across different model providers
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Standardized access to tools and external systems
- **Simplified Development**: Consistent patterns for model interactions
- **Improved Reliability**: Structured error handling and feedback loops

## MCP vs. Traditional APIs

| Aspect | Traditional API | Model Context Protocol |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| State Management | Stateless or simple | Rich context preservation |
| Tool Access | Limited or custom | Standardized function calling |
| Message Structure | Domain-specific | Universal message format |
| Error Handling | HTTP status codes | Rich semantic error responses |
| Model Swapping | Requires code changes | Minimal adaptation needed |
