## Setup Examples

### OpenAI API Integration

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your_api_key")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain how language models work."}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### AWS Bedrock Integration

```python
import boto3
import json

bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')

response = bedrock.invoke_model(
    modelId='anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
    body=json.dumps({
        "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain how language models work."}
        ]
    })
)

result = json.loads(response['body'].read())
print(result['content'][0]['text'])
```

### Local Deployment with Ollama

```python
import requests
import json

response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:11434/api/generate',
    json={
        'model': 'llama3',
        'prompt': 'Explain how language models work.',
        'stream': False
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(result['response'])
```

## Conclusion

The model landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace. When selecting a model or provider for your application, consider the balance between performance, cost, privacy, and ease of integration. Many organizations adopt a hybrid approach, using different models for different use cases based on their specific requirements.
