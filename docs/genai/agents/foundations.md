# Foundations of AI Agents

AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specified goals. With the emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), agent systems have become significantly more capable, enabling complex reasoning and action sequences beyond what was previously possible.

## What Are AI Agents?

An AI agent can be defined as a system that:
1. **Perceives** its environment through inputs
2. **Processes** these inputs to make decisions
3. **Takes actions** that affect its environment
4. **Learns and adapts** from experience
5. **Pursues goals** or objectives

The agent paradigm represents a shift from passive AI systems that simply respond to queries toward active systems that can autonomously pursue objectives over extended interactions.

## Core Components of AI Agents

### 1. Memory Systems

Agents require memory to maintain context and learn from experience:

```python
class AgentMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.short_term_memory = []  # Recent interactions and context
        self.long_term_memory = {}   # Persistent knowledge and experiences
    
    def add_to_short_term_memory(self, item):
        """Add an item to short-term memory, maintaining limited size"""
        self.short_term_memory.append(item)
        # Keep short-term memory at a manageable size
        if len(self.short_term_memory) > 10:
            self.short_term_memory.pop(0)
    
    def store_in_long_term_memory(self, key, value):
        """Store important information in long-term memory"""
        self.long_term_memory[key] = value
    
    def retrieve_from_long_term_memory(self, key):
        """Retrieve information from long-term memory"""
        return self.long_term_memory.get(key, None)
    
    def get_relevant_context(self, query):
        """Get relevant context from both memory systems"""
        context = {
            "short_term": self.short_term_memory,
            "long_term": {}
        }
        
        # For simplicity, we're just returning recent items from short-term
        # In a real system, you would implement relevance filtering
        
        # Search long-term memory for relevant items
        for key, value in self.long_term_memory.items():
            if query.lower() in key.lower():
                context["long_term"][key] = value
                
        return context
```

More sophisticated agent memory systems include:

1. **Vector stores**: Using embeddings to store and retrieve semantic information
2. **Episodic memory**: Recording past interactions as episodes
3. **Declarative memory**: Storing facts and information
4. **Procedural memory**: Remembering how to perform tasks

### 2. Planning and Reasoning

Agents need to plan sequences of actions and reason about their consequences:

```python
import json
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

class AgentPlanner:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=model_name, temperature=0)
    
    def create_plan(self, objective: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
        """Generate a step-by-step plan to achieve an objective"""
        
        prompt = f"""
        You are an AI planning assistant. Based on the objective and context below,
        create a step-by-step plan to achieve the objective.
        
        Objective: {objective}
        
        Current Context:
        {json.dumps(context, indent=2)}
        
        For each step, include:
        1. A description of the action to take
        2. The expected outcome of the action
        3. Potential contingencies if the action fails
        
        Format the response as a JSON array of steps, where each step has fields:
        "action", "expected_outcome", and "contingency".
        """
        
        response = self.llm.predict(prompt)
        
        try:
            # Parse the response as JSON
            plan = json.loads(response)
            return plan
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            # Fallback parsing if the output isn't perfect JSON
            # In a real system, you would have more robust parsing
            steps = []
            for line in response.split("\n"):
                if "Step" in line and ":" in line:
                    parts = line.split(":", 1)
                    steps.append({"action": parts[1].strip()})
            return steps
    
    def evaluate_plan_progress(self, plan: List[Dict[str, str]], completed_steps: List[int]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Evaluate the progress of a plan and recommend adjustments if needed"""
        completed = [plan[i] for i in completed_steps if i < len(plan)]
        pending = [step for i, step in enumerate(plan) if i not in completed_steps]
        
        evaluation = {
            "total_steps": len(plan),
            "completed_steps": len(completed),
            "pending_steps": len(pending),
            "progress_percentage": len(completed) / len(plan) * 100 if plan else 0,
            "next_step": pending[0] if pending else None
        };
        
        return evaluation
```

Advanced planning approaches include:
- **Hierarchical planning**: Breaking complex goals into subtasks
- **Model-based planning**: Simulating actions and their outcomes
- **Tree of Thoughts**: Exploring multiple reasoning paths
- **ReAct**: Interleaving reasoning and action steps

### 3. Tool Use

Modern AI agents can use tools to interact with external systems:

```python
import requests
import datetime
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Callable

class ToolRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}
        
    def register_tool(self, name: str, function: Callable, description: str):
        """Register a new tool"""
        self.tools[name] = {
            "function": function,
            "description": description
        }
        
    def get_tool_descriptions(self) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
        """Get descriptions of all available tools"""
        return [
            {"name": name, "description": details["description"]}
            for name, details in self.tools.items()
        ]
        
    def execute_tool(self, tool_name: str, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Execute a tool by name with provided arguments"""
        if tool_name not in self.tools:
            raise ValueError(f"Tool {tool_name} not found")
            
        return self.tools[tool_name]["function"](**kwargs)

# Example tools that might be available to an agent
def search_web(query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Simulated web search tool"""
    # In a real implementation, this would call a search API
    return {
        "results": [
            {"title": f"Result for {query}", "snippet": f"This is information about {query}"},
            {"title": f"Another result for {query}", "snippet": f"More information about {query}"}
        ]
    }

def check_weather(location: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get current weather for a location"""
    # This would normally call a weather API
    return {
        "location": location,
        "temperature": "72Â°F",
        "conditions": "Partly Cloudy"
    }

def get_current_time() -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Get the current date and time"""
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    return {
        "date": now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "time": now.strftime("%H:%M:%S"),
        "timezone": "UTC"
    }

# Set up the tool registry
registry = ToolRegistry()
registry.register_tool("search", search_web, "Search the web for information")
registry.register_tool("weather", check_weather, "Check the current weather for a location")
registry.register_tool("time", get_current_time, "Get the current date and time")
```

### 4. Decision Making

Agents need to decide which actions to take based on their current state and goals:

```python
class AgentDecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=model_name, temperature=0.2)
    
    def decide_next_action(
        self, 
        objective: str, 
        context: Dict[str, Any], 
        available_tools: List[Dict[str, str]], 
        previous_actions: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Decide the next action to take based on the current context and available tools
        """
        prompt = f"""
        You are an autonomous AI agent working to achieve this objective: {objective}
        
        Current context:
        {json.dumps(context, indent=2)}
        
        Your previous actions:
        {json.dumps(previous_actions, indent=2)}
        
        Available tools:
        {json.dumps(available_tools, indent=2)}
        
        Based on your objective and the current context, decide what action to take next.
        
        Respond with a JSON object with the following fields:
        1. "reasoning": Your step-by-step reasoning about what to do next
        2. "tool": The name of the tool to use (must be one from the available tools list)
        3. "tool_input": The parameters to pass to the tool
        4. "expected_outcome": What you expect to learn or achieve with this action
        """
        
        response = self.llm.predict(prompt)
        
        try:
            # Parse the response as JSON
            decision = json.loads(response)
            return decision
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            # Fallback response if parsing fails
            return {
                "reasoning": "Parsing error occurred",
                "tool": None,
                "tool_input": {},
                "expected_outcome": "Need to retry with a better-formatted response"
            }
```

## Agent Architectures

Various architectures have been developed for AI agents:

### 1. Basic ReAct Agent

The ReAct pattern (Reasoning + Acting) interleaves reasoning steps with action execution:

```python
class ReActAgent:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=model_name, temperature=0)
        self.memory = AgentMemory()
        self.tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
        
        # Register some default tools
        self.tool_registry.register_tool(
            "search", search_web, "Search the web for information"
        )
        self.tool_registry.register_tool(
            "weather", check_weather, "Check the current weather for a location"
        )
    
    def run(self, objective: str, max_iterations: int = 5):
        """Run the ReAct agent to achieve an objective"""
        results = []
        
        for i in range(max_iterations):
            # Get relevant context from memory
            context = self.memory.get_relevant_context(objective)
            
            # Format the prompt with ReAct pattern
            prompt = f"""
            You are an autonomous agent working to achieve this objective: {objective}
            
            Current context: {json.dumps(context, indent=2)}
            
            Available tools: {json.dumps(self.tool_registry.get_tool_descriptions(), indent=2)}
            
            Follow this process:
            1. Think: Analyze the current situation and decide what to do
            2. Act: Choose a tool and specify its inputs
            3. Observe: Review the results of your action
            
            Previous iterations:
            {json.dumps(results, indent=2)}
            
            Now provide your next think-act-observe sequence.
            Format your response as JSON with fields: "think", "act", "act_input"
            """
            
            # Get the agent's response
            response = self.llm.predict(prompt)
            
            try:
                step = json.loads(response)
                
                # Execute the chosen tool
                tool_name = step.get("act")
                tool_input = step.get("act_input", {})
                
                if tool_name in self.tool_registry.tools:
                    observation = self.tool_registry.execute_tool(tool_name, **tool_input)
                    step["observation"] = observation
                else:
                    step["observation"] = f"Error: Tool '{tool_name}' not found"
                
                # Add to results
                results.append(step)
                
                # Store in memory
                self.memory.add_to_short_term_memory(step)
                
                # Check if objective is complete
                completion_check = self.llm.predict(
                    f"Based on the objective '{objective}' and the current results {json.dumps(results)}, "
                    f"is the objective fully achieved? Answer with only 'yes' or 'no'."
                )
                
                if "yes" in completion_check.lower():
                    break
                    
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                results.append({
                    "error": "Failed to parse response as JSON",
                    "raw_response": response
                })
        
        return results
```

### 2. Task-Specific Agent

Specialized for a particular domain or task:

```python
class ResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=model_name, temperature=0.2)
        self.memory = AgentMemory()
        self.tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
        
        # Register research-specific tools
        self.tool_registry.register_tool(
            "search_academic", self.search_academic, 
            "Search academic papers and journals"
        )
        self.tool_registry.register_tool(
            "summarize", self.summarize_content,
            "Summarize lengthy content into key points"
        )
        self.tool_registry.register_tool(
            "extract_citations", self.extract_citations,
            "Extract citation information from papers"
        )
    
    def search_academic(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Simulated academic search tool"""
        # In a real implementation, this would call an academic API
        return {
            "papers": [
                {
                    "title": f"Research on {query}",
                    "authors": ["Smith, J.", "Johnson, M."],
                    "year": 2023,
                    "abstract": f"This paper explores {query} in detail..."
                }
            ]
        }
    
    def summarize_content(self, content: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Summarize content using an LLM"""
        summary = self.llm.predict(f"Summarize the following content into 3-5 key points:\n{content}")
        return {"summary": summary}
    
    def extract_citations(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Extract citations from text"""
        # This would normally use a more sophisticated extraction approach
        return {"citations": ["Smith et al., 2023", "Johnson, 2022"]}
    
    def conduct_research(self, topic: str, depth: int = 3):
        """Conduct research on a topic with specified depth"""
        research_output = {
            "topic": topic,
            "summary": "",
            "key_findings": [],
            "sources": []
        }
        
        # Initial search
        search_results = self.tool_registry.execute_tool("search_academic", query=topic)
        self.memory.add_to_short_term_memory(search_results)
        
        # Process each paper
        for paper in search_results.get("papers", []):
            # In a real system, we would fetch and process the full paper
            paper_summary = self.tool_registry.execute_tool(
                "summarize", content=paper.get("abstract", "")
            )
            research_output["key_findings"].append({
                "paper": paper.get("title"),
                "summary": paper_summary.get("summary")
            })
            research_output["sources"].append(
                f"{', '.join(paper.get('authors', []))} ({paper.get('year', 'n.d.')}). "
                f"{paper.get('title')}"
            )
        
        # Generate overall research summary
        findings_text = "\n".join([f"- {f['summary']}" for f in research_output["key_findings"]])
        research_output["summary"] = self.llm.predict(
            f"Based on the following research findings about {topic}, provide a comprehensive "
            f"summary that synthesizes the information:\n\n{findings_text}"
        )
        
        return research_output
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Systems

Multiple agents working together, potentially with different roles:

```python
class MultiAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=model_name, temperature=0.2)
        self.agents = {}
        self.shared_memory = AgentMemory()
    
    def create_agent(self, name: str, role: str, tools: List[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
        """Create and register a new agent with a specific role"""
        agent = {
            "name": name,
            "role": role,
            "tools": tools or [],
            "memory": AgentMemory(),  # Individual memory
            "messages": []  # Agent-specific message history
        }
        self.agents[name] = agent
        return agent
    
    def agent_communication(
        self,
        sender: str,
        receiver: str,
        message: str,
        require_response: bool = True
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Handle communication between agents"""
        if sender not in self.agents:
            return {"error": f"Agent {sender} does not exist"}
        
        if receiver not in self.agents:
            return {"error": f"Agent {receiver} does not exist"}
        
        # Record the message in both agents' histories
        msg_obj = {
            "from": sender,
            "to": receiver,
            "message": message,
            "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
        
        self.agents[sender]["messages"].append(msg_obj)
        self.agents[receiver]["messages"].append(msg_obj)
        
        # Also store in shared memory
        self.shared_memory.add_to_short_term_memory(msg_obj)
        
        # Generate response if required
        if require_response:
            receiver_agent = self.agents[receiver]
            response_prompt = f"""
            You are {receiver_agent['name']}, a {receiver_agent['role']}.
            
            You have received the following message from {sender}:
            "{message}"

## Agent Applications

AI agents have diverse applications across domains:

### 1. Research Assistants

Agents can help with literature review, data analysis, and summarization:

```python
# Usage example of the ResearchAgent
research_agent = ResearchAgent()
results = research_agent.conduct_research("transformer architectures in LLMs", depth=3)
print(f"Research Summary:\n{results['summary']}")
print("\nKey Sources:")
for source in results["sources"]:
    print(f"- {source}")
```

### 2. Automation Agents

Agents can automate workflows and repetitive tasks:

```python
class AutomationAgent:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=model_name, temperature=0.1)

1. **Improved reasoning capabilities**: Agents are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to reason, allowing them to tackle complex, multi-step problems.

2. **Self-improvement**: Agents that can evaluate their own performance and improve over time.

3. **Agent societies**: Groups of specialized agents working together in complex ecosystems.

4. **Multi-modal agents**: Systems that can process and generate text, images, audio, and video.

5. **Personalization**: Agents that adapt to individual user preferences and needs.

## Ethical and Practical Considerations

When developing and deploying AI agents, several important considerations must be addressed:

1. **Autonomy limits**: Setting appropriate boundaries for agent autonomy
2. **Human oversight**: Maintaining proper human supervision
3. **Alignment**: Ensuring agents act in accordance with human values and intentions
4. **Safety**: Protecting against unintended consequences
5. **Privacy**: Handling sensitive information appropriately
6. **Transparency**: Making agent decision-making understandable

AI agents represent a powerful paradigm for building systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. As the technology continues to mature, we'll see increasingly capable agents applied across a wide range of domains, augmenting human capabilities and automating complex tasks.
