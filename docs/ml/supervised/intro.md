# Introduction to Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. Each training example consists of an input and a corresponding output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can generalize to unseen data.

## Key Concepts
- **Training Data**: Labeled examples used to train the model.
- **Features**: Input variables used to make predictions.
- **Labels**: Output variables the model is trying to predict.
- **Loss Function**: Measures the error between predicted and actual labels.

## Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

Supervised learning is widely used in applications like spam detection, image classification, and predictive analytics.
