# Examples of Supervised Learning

## Example 1: Spam Detection
- **Input**: Email text
- **Output**: Spam or Not Spam
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes Classifier

## Example 2: Image Classification
- **Input**: Image pixels
- **Output**: Categories (e.g., Dog, Cat, Car)
- **Algorithm**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Example 3: Predictive Analytics
- **Input**: Historical sales data
- **Output**: Future sales predictions
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression

These examples demonstrate the versatility of supervised learning in solving real-world problems.
