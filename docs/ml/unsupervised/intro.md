# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data. The goal is to identify patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without predefined labels.

## Key Concepts
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while preserving important information.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual data points.

## Common Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

Unsupervised learning is commonly used in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data visualization.
