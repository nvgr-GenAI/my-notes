# Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It is widely used in various applications, from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.

## ML Learning Approaches

Machine learning models are broadly classified into four categories based on the learning approach. Each approach has distinct characteristics in terms of data requirements, training methodology, and suitable use cases.

- [Supervised Learning](supervised/intro.md)
- [Unsupervised Learning](unsupervised/intro.md)
- [Semi-supervised Learning](semi-supervised/intro.md)
- [Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement/intro.md)

Note: Neural Networks are not a separate learning category but rather a model architecture that can be implemented across any of these learning approaches.

## Core ML Components

### Data
- **Training Data**: Used to build the initial model
- **Validation Data**: Used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting
- **Test Data**: Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data

### Features
- The properties or attributes extracted from data that are used for learning
- Feature engineering is crucial for model performance
- Can be numerical, categorical, textual, or multimedia

### Models
- Mathematical representations that map inputs to outputs
- Range from simple linear models to complex deep neural networks
- Choice of model depends on data, task, and available resources

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score for classification
- RMSE, MAE, R² for regression
- Domain-specific metrics for specialized tasks

## ML Development Process

The machine learning development lifecycle involves multiple stages from problem definition to deployment and monitoring. For a comprehensive look at each stage with best practices and common challenges, see our detailed [ML Development Lifecycle](development-lifecycle.md) guide.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias and Fairness**: Models may perpetuate or amplify societal biases
- **Transparency**: "Black box" models lack interpretability
- **Privacy**: Training data may contain sensitive information
- **Security**: Models may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks

## Current Trends in Machine Learning (2025)

- **Federated Learning**: Training models across devices while preserving privacy
- **Few-shot Learning**: Models that can learn from limited examples
- **Self-supervised Learning**: Leveraging unlabeled data for pre-training
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Developing transparent models that explain decisions
- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**: Automating the ML workflow
- **Edge ML**: Deploying models on edge devices with limited compute
- **Multimodal Learning**: Models that can process multiple types of inputs (text, images, audio)
