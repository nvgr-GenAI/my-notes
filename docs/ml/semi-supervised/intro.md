# Semi-supervised Learning

## Introduction

Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that combines both labeled and unlabeled data during training. This approach is particularly valuable when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, but unlabeled data is abundant.

## Key Concepts

- **Combination of Data Types**: Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the need for extensive manual labeling
- **Bridging Approach**: Falls between supervised and unsupervised learning

## Common Techniques

1. **Self-Training**
   - Model trains on labeled data first
   - Then predicts labels for unlabeled data
   - High-confidence predictions are added to the training set
   - Process repeats iteratively

2. **Co-Training**
   - Uses multiple models trained on different views of the data
   - Each model helps label data for the other models

3. **Semi-supervised SVMs**
   - Modified Support Vector Machines that incorporate unlabeled data
   - Uses transductive learning approach

4. **Graph-Based Methods**
   - Represents data points as nodes in a graph
   - Similar data points are connected by edges
   - Labels can propagate through the graph

## Applications

- **Text Classification**: When only a subset of documents can be manually classified
- **Image Recognition**: Using partially labeled image datasets
- **Speech Analysis**: When transcribing all audio data is impractical
- **Medical Diagnosis**: When expert diagnosis is available for only some cases

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Requires less labeled data than supervised learning
- Can achieve higher accuracy than using labeled data alone
- More practical for real-world applications with data labeling constraints

### Limitations
- Incorrect assumptions about unlabeled data can degrade performance
- Implementation complexity is higher than pure supervised approaches
- Theoretical guarantees are weaker compared to supervised learning
