# Examples of Reinforcement Learning

## Example 1: Game Playing
- **Input**: Game state
- **Output**: Optimal moves
- **Algorithm**: Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

## Example 2: Robotics
- **Input**: Sensor data
- **Output**: Motor commands
- **Algorithm**: Policy Gradient Methods

## Example 3: Autonomous Driving
- **Input**: Road conditions
- **Output**: Steering and acceleration
- **Algorithm**: Actor-Critic Methods

These examples showcase the potential of reinforcement learning in dynamic and interactive environments.
