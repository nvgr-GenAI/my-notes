# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Key Concepts
- **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
- **Environment**: The system the agent interacts with.
- **Reward**: Feedback signal for the agent's actions.
- **Policy**: Strategy used by the agent to decide actions.
- **Value Function**: Estimates the expected reward for a state or action.

## Common Algorithms
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Methods

Reinforcement learning is used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.
