# Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. They are the foundation of computer science and are essential for efficient software development.

## Key Topics
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A* Search)
- Dynamic Programming

Understanding algorithms is crucial for solving complex problems and optimizing performance.
