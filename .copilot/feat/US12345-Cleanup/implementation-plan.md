# US12345-Cleanup - Implementation Plan

## Milestone 1: Remove Existing "Blog" Feature

**Description:** Identify and remove all files, configurations, and navigation elements related to the default Docusaurus "Blog" feature that came with the initial project setup.
**Expected Outcome:** The existing "Blog" tab/section and its content will be completely removed from the Docusaurus site. The site will build and run without errors related to the blog. All links and references to the old blog will be gone.

## Milestone 2: Remove Existing "Tutorials" Feature

**Description:** Identify and remove all files, configurations, and navigation elements related to the "Tutorials" tab/section.
**Expected Outcome:** The "Tutorials" tab/section and its content will be completely removed from the Docusaurus site. The site will build and run without errors related to tutorials. All links and references to the tutorials section will be gone.

- Removed references to the "Tutorials" feature as it has been completely removed.

## Milestone 3: Configure New "Blogs" Section for Sidebar

**Description:** Set up a new blog feature or reconfigure the existing Docusaurus blog plugin to display blog posts, with a link or section appearing in a sidebar (presumably the right sidebar as mentioned). This will be distinct from the main navigation tabs.
**Expected Outcome:** A new "Blogs" area is accessible, likely via a sidebar. The main navigation bar will not have a "Blog" tab from this setup. The site will build and run correctly.

## Milestone 4: Create Dummy "GenAI" Blog Post

**Description:** Add a single placeholder blog post about "GenAI" into the newly configured "Blogs" section.
**Expected Outcome:** The dummy "GenAI" blog post will be visible and accessible within the new "Blogs" section.

## Milestone 5: Update Home Page Content

**Description:** Modify the content of the home page to align with the new vision: a learning site for ML, GenAI, System Design, and Algorithms, serving as a resource for Engineers, Architects, and Product roles for learning material, best practices, and interview preparation.
**Expected Outcome:** The home page text, and potentially its structure, will be updated to clearly communicate the site's new purpose and target audience.

## Milestone 6: Final Verification and Cleanup

**Description:** Perform a full site review to ensure all changes are correctly implemented, navigation links are accurate, there are no broken links, and the site builds and runs as expected.
**Expected Outcome:** The Docusaurus site correctly reflects all the changes, is free of errors, and provides a clean user experience.
