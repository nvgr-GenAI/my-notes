# US12345-Cleanup - Introduction

## Introduction
This feature involves cleaning up the Docusaurus website by removing unwanted sections that were part of the initial project setup. Specifically, the "Blog" and "Tutorials" tabs (and their associated content/functionality) will be removed.

## Goal
The goal is to simplify the Docusaurus site by removing unused features, making the site cleaner and more focused on its primary content.

## Context
The Docusaurus project was set up with default features that included a "Blog" and a "Tutorials" section. These sections are not required for the current project and are considered clutter.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Identify all files and configuration related to the "Blog" feature in Docusaurus.
- Identify all files and configuration related to the "Tutorials" feature in Docusaurus.
- Remove the identified files and update configurations to reflect the removal.
- Ensure the Docusaurus site builds and runs correctly without the "Tutorials" sections.
- Verify that navigation links and any references to these sections are removed.
- Removed references to the "Tutorials" feature as it has been completely removed.
- Create a Blogs on right side with dummy blog about GenAI.
- Update home page to reflect a site for learning which will have ML, GeNAI, System Design, Algorithms.
- This site is like one place for Engineer, Architects and product to look for learning material, best practices and prep for interviews.
